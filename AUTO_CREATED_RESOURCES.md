# Understanding Auto-Created Azure Resources

## Overview

When you deploy an Azure AI Foundry project, some resources are automatically created by Azure to support the functionality you've requested. These resources are **normal and expected** - they're not errors or unexpected deployments.

## Auto-Created Resources Explained

### 1. **Smart Detector Alert Rules**
```
Type: microsoft.alertsmanagement/smartDetectorAlertRules
```
- **Purpose**: Automatically detects anomalies in your Application Insights data
- **Created by**: Application Insights deployment
- **Function**: Monitors for performance issues, failures, and unusual patterns
- **Cost**: No additional cost - part of Application Insights

### 2. **Action Groups**
```
Type: microsoft.insights/actiongroups
```
- **Purpose**: Defines how alerts are handled and who gets notified
- **Created by**: Application Insights and Azure Monitor
- **Function**: Manages alert notifications (email, SMS, webhooks, etc.)
- **Cost**: No additional cost for basic notifications

### 3. **Additional Monitoring Resources** (if present)
```
Type: microsoft.insights/webtests
Type: microsoft.insights/workbooks
```
- **Purpose**: Web availability testing and custom dashboards
- **Created by**: Application Insights (depending on configuration)
- **Function**: Monitors web endpoint availability and provides visualization

## Why These Resources Appear

### Automatic Creation
Azure automatically creates supporting resources when you deploy certain services:

1. **Application Insights** → Creates smart detection rules and action groups
2. **Log Analytics** → May create default queries and dashboards
3. **Azure Monitor** → Creates default alert rules and notification channels

### Benefits
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Automatically detects issues before they impact users
- **Intelligent Alerting**: Uses machine learning to reduce false positives
- **Integrated Experience**: Provides seamless monitoring without manual setup

## Managing Auto-Created Resources

### Viewing Resources
```bash
# List all resources in your resource group
az resource list --resource-group "your-resource-group" --output table

# Filter for monitoring resources
az resource list --resource-group "your-resource-group" \
  --resource-type "microsoft.insights/actiongroups" \
  --output table
```

### Customizing Alerts
```bash
# List smart detector alert rules
az monitor app-insights component show \
  --resource-group "your-resource-group" \
  --app "your-app-insights-name"

# View action groups
az monitor action-group list \
  --resource-group "your-resource-group"
```

### Deleting (Not Recommended)
⚠️ **Warning**: Deleting these resources will disable monitoring and alerting capabilities.

```bash
# Only delete if you're sure you don't need monitoring
az resource delete --resource-group "your-resource-group" \
  --name "smart-detector-name" \
  --resource-type "microsoft.alertsmanagement/smartDetectorAlertRules"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Keep Auto-Created Resources**
- These resources provide valuable monitoring capabilities
- They're designed to work optimally with your deployed services
- No additional cost for basic functionality

### 2. **Customize Notifications**
- Configure action groups to send alerts to your preferred channels
- Set up different notification rules for different types of alerts
- Use Azure Monitor to create custom alert rules

### 3. **Monitor Resource Usage**
- Use Azure Cost Management to track costs
- Most auto-created resources are free or very low cost
- Consider upgrading to paid tiers for advanced features

## Configuration Examples

### Configure Action Group for Email Notifications
```bash
az monitor action-group create \
  --resource-group "your-resource-group" \
  --name "ai-foundry-alerts" \
  --short-name "aifalerts" \
  --action email your-email@domain.com your-email@domain.com
```

### Create Custom Alert Rule
```bash
az monitor metrics alert create \
  --name "high-ai-service-usage" \
  --resource-group "your-resource-group" \
  --scopes "/subscriptions/your-sub-id/resourceGroups/your-rg/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/your-ai-service" \
  --condition "avg Percentage CPU > 80" \
  --action "/subscriptions/your-sub-id/resourceGroups/your-rg/providers/microsoft.insights/actiongroups/ai-foundry-alerts"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Too Many Alerts
**Solution**: Adjust smart detection sensitivity or create custom rules

### Issue: Not Receiving Alerts
**Solution**: Check action group configuration and email settings

### Issue: Unexpected Costs
**Solution**: Review Azure Monitor pricing and adjust retention settings
